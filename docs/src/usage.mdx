# Basic Usage

## Import package

```ts
import DXClient from '@dxfeed/widgets-api'
```

## Configure & Create connection

Create instance of DXClient and set web socket address and open connection.

```ts
import DXClient from '@dxfeed/widgets-api'

const client = new DXClient('wss://CLIENT_NAME.dxfeed.com/api/rsocket')
```

## Configure & Create subscription
You should specify the record and the requested symbols.

```ts
import { QuoteSubscription } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/Quote'

const subscription = await client.subscribe(
  new QuoteSubscription(
    ['AAPL'] /* symbols */
  )
)
```

The full list of records can be found here:
```js
import { /* Subscription */ } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/*'
```

You can specify fields you want to request for each type of event. This can be achieved by passing a list of them as a second parameter of `Subscription`. If no value provided (i.e. parameter is `undefined`), a default set of fields will be requested. List of event types with all available fields for each of them can be found [here](https://studio.asyncapi.com/?url=https://dxfeed-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/dxFeed-WebApi-alpha.yaml).
```ts
client.subscribe(
  new QuoteSubscription(
    symbols,
    ['eventSymbol', 'bidPrice'] /* fields */
  )
)
```
NOTE: `eventSymbol` field is mandatory for all types of events. If you want to request a subset of fields, you must include `eventSymbol`.

Some of the events may may be requested using timed subscription (i.e. with inclusion of historical data). These are: 

- `Candle` 
- `Greeks` 
- `TheoPrice`
- `TimeAndSale`
- `Underlying`

For timed subscription you should also provide time to start subscription from.
```ts
client.subscribe(
  new CandleSubscription(
    symbols,
    fields,
    1500000000000 /* from time */
  )
)
```

NOTE: for timed events requested with custom selection of fields, an `eventFlags` field is also mandatory.
```ts
/* Timed subscription, requesting a default set of fields */

client.subscribe(
  new CandleSubscription(
    symbols,
    undefined,
    1500000000000
  )
)

/* Timed subscription, requesting a custom set of fields */

client.subscribe(
  new CandleSubscription(
    symbols,
    ['eventSymbol', 'eventFlags', 'high', 'low'],
    1500000000000
  )
)
```

## Change symbols in subscription

### Add symbols

```ts
subscription.addSymbols(['MSFT'])
```

### Remove symbols

```ts
subscription.removeSymbols(['AAPL'])
```

## Get events from stream
After an open subscription, you can listen to events from the stream.

```ts
const stream = subscription.getStream()

stream.subscribe({
  onSubscribe: sub => {
    sub.request(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) // set backpressure
  },
  onNext: handleEvents,
})
```

`onNext` its event handler for process incoming events.

```ts
import { Quote } from '@dxfeed/widgets-api/records/Quote'

const handleEvents = (events: Quote[]) => {
  /* process events */
}
```

## Close subscription stream
All `onSubscribe` callbacks that are called with a subscription, you need to call the `subs.close` method to close the stream.

```ts
stream.subscribe({
  onSubscribe: sub => {
    setTimeout(() => sub.close(), 5000) // close after 5s
  },
  onNext: console.log,
})
```

## Close connection
If you need to close the web socket connection

```ts
client.close()
```
